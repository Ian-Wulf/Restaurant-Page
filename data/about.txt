Tojo's Noodle Bar was founded in 1983 by Tojo Tanaka right here in Ohio. Tojo wanted to bring a taste of his home in Japan here to the States to share with those in his new home and community. He hopes to share the same feeling of warmth and joy that these dishes brought to him growing up with others.
